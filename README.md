# Backtracking-Morsecode

These python scripts demonstrate different algorithmic techniques including backtracking recursion and trie trees. 
Due to the time complexity of these different algorithms and their lack of read and write time they were also
great for showing the power of pythons built in multiprocessing library by running the algorithm in parallel.
